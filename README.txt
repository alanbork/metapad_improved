Working Title: 

Extraordinary Notepad (e.exe), a continuation of Liquidninja's MetaPad

A notepad alternative that maintains the small size and quick loading that Notepad was famous for in the pre Win11 era, BUT adds many useful editing commands like block commands where you can strip the first character from every selected line, etc. It exists as a halfway between the simplicity of the original notepad and the greater power of Notepad++, and is very distant from the power and bloat of a full code editor like VScode.


Project Constraints:

Philosophy: maintain the project's "bare-metal" philosophy. Changes should be minimal, and no new dependencies should be added. 

Build Environment: I build with VC6. While this limits any modern techniques it does produce gloriously small .exe files. 

The original readme for this project when it was still metapad follows.


This package contains the source code to metapad 
(version 3.51). What follows is a few points I'd like to
make regarding this distribution:

1) The metapad code has been released under the GNU 
   General Public License. This fact directly impacts 
   what you can and cannot do with the source code. See 
   the file COPYING-LICENSE.txt (included in this 
   distribution) which will explain things in detail. 

2) This source code in its current state is uncommented, 
   unmodular, and generally not very understandable
   for anyone that is not deeply familiar with it. All 
   of the code is contained in one 8000 line file. Of 
   course this is not the best way to write software 
   that others may read (which was not a concern when 
   I originally wrote it).

3) I no longer consider myself a win32 programming 
   expert by any means. If you are confused by anything 
   you find here please contact your local C/win32 guru.
   
Hope you enjoy. That is all.
